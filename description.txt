A sonification journey with Kepler through 64 exo-planets

Our hero Kepler takes a sonification journey through 64 exo-planents detected by the Kepler telescope.
At each bar Kepler arrives a melody is played to honor him by the habitants of the planet.
Of course Kepler has taken the path described by an approximate travelling salesman problem solver to minize
melody surprise.

Of course our hero wants to leave some track for others to find him, so he points to this dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results

and he also recursively points to how this sonification journey was generated:

Knowing that 42 is the answer to all things, Kepler points to a random state = 42 which will not allow the exact duplication of
this sonification journey for others to follow.
